Monster Hunter Mod for Minecraft
by daedad

<Purpose>
The purpose of this mod is to bring monster hunting to survival minecraft. My goal is for players
to have a challenging experience in survival minecraft by adding an abundance of items, plants, ores,
armor, weapons, and monsters from the Monster Hunter Universe.
</Purpose>

<Changelog>
v0.1 - Created the basic classes for a working mod. Added Earth Crystal, Earth Crystal Block,
	and Earth Crystal Ore. Earth Crystal Ore generates in the world and drops one Earth Crystal.
	Nine Earth Crystals can be combined to create an Earth Crystal Block.
	
v0.2 - Added in several new items: Bird Wyvern Fang, Jaggi Hide, Jaggi Scale, Kelbi Horn, 
    Warm Pelt, Monster Bone S, and Mystery Bone. I also added a Mystery Bone Block made with 
	nine mystery bones. This version also includes huskberries, with can be planted on farmland.
	They also generate in the world, very very exciting.

<Planned Updates>
There's a few things I want implemented before the first release.
Items: honey, potion, recover s(maybe), herb, blue mushroom, rare steak, well done steak, burnt meat,
raw meat, mega potion, as well as any other combo I missed for these items. I want the herb and blue
mushrooms to spawn naturally, as well as the honey. I want to spawn beehives naturally(kinda like cocoa beans)
and make them a tile entitiy that will spit out honey...or maybe we break them and get honey and 'plant' something
back on the tree...sounds easier. I also want to craft a block of honey(like slime block). I want to implement the
leather, derring, and chainmail armor from MH4U as well as Iron sword, iron sword+, bone blade, bone blade+,
large bone, hunter's bow 1, hunters bow 2. For monsters, I want to see aptonoth, jaggi, and kelbi to start.
